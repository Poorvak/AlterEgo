Dear,

My name is Nicolaas Matthijs and I'm currently doing a Masters Degree
in Computer Speech, Text and Internet Technology [1] at the University
of Cambridge, UK. 

Before this, I have worked for 2.5 years as a front-end web developer
and project manager. The course I am currently undertaking is mainly
about Speech Recognition, Speech Synthesis and Natural Language
Processing. I have also attached a copy of my CV.

An essential part of my degree is undertaking a 3.5 month research
project in this area. This will run from March 15 until the last week
of June. I'm currently doing most reading in statistical
machine translation, but I'm very much open to any research proposals
as my interests are very broad. The course lecturers provide us with
a list of possible projects, but we are also allowed to suggests projects
ourselves/in cooperation with Industry. As I am very keen to work on
something that is potentially directly applicable in industry and directly
useful for real people out there, I was hoping that Google could provide
me with a project and supervise me. This would not take up a lot of time
though. 

Google is my preferred choice because as a web developer I found out that Google
was always doing the most innovative things in the areas I was developing in.
Coming into Natural Language Processing, it's again Google that is doing a lot
of the innovation. I would like to contribute to that.

Just to give you an idea, these are a few examples of research projects this year:

- Class-based Language Models for the Rescoring of Translation Lattices
- Incorporating Syntax into Hierarchical Phrase-based Translation Rules
- Improving the Performance of a Wide-Coverage Parser on Unbounded Dependency Recovery
- Speaker Adaptation using the Bilinear Model
- Optimal decision trees for adaptation of HMM-based speech synthesis
- ...

I'm very keen to discuss possible projects with you. A decision would need to be
made before the 5th of February. If you cannot help me, but are aware of other groups
within your company that could, feel free to forward this e-mail to them.


Thanks in advance and hoping to collaborate with you,

Nicolaas Matthijs
