AlterEgo :: Personalized Web Search
-----------------------------------

This code is the result of a research project conducted in Easter Term 2010 
in order to obtain the MPhil Computer Speech, Text and Internet Technology 
at the University of Cambridge. It investigates the use of profile based 
personalized web search using browsing history and thorough offline and 
online evaluation in a complete and self-contained research project. It 
involves the full research cycle and includes pre-research investigation, 
suggesting and implementing a new personalization strategy, capturing data, 
finding participants, two different evaluations, parameter investigation, 
comparison to previous best systems and making the developed Firefox add-on 
available for real-life usage.
