  		<h3>More about this add-on</h3>
  		<div class="article prose userinput">
			<h4>Can you tell me more about the project?</h4>
			<p style="margin-bottom:0.4em;">
     			Different people look for different things with the same queries. Classic examples include queries like jaguar, Columbia, flash, mercury. My research project will involve creating a <b>personalized search system</b>. The first part of the project involves generating an interest profile for the 
user. This will in the first instance be based on the browser history and the search queries of that user. In order to capture all of this data, this add-on has been written to provide me with training and testing data. It is very important that you install this add-on, as I need as much data as possible. <br/>The second part of the project will involve using this user profile to predict which Wikipedia disambiguation is the most interesting to a user or to re- 
rank the output of a search engine. The results will then be evaluated in the third part of the project.<br />          
			</p>
			<br/>
			<h4>What will this add-on do?</h4>
			<p style="margin-bottom:0.4em;">
     			This version of the add-on will just observe you while browsing. It will run quietly in the background and will not get in your way at any time. Every time you go to a new website the add-on will submit the URL and source HTML of the page you're on to a server capturing this data. Note: if you worry about your privacy, please read "How about my privacy?". All of this will be saved in a database that will later on be used as the basis for creating my training and test set. The plug-in will stop capturing data on the 1st of April. At some point after that, an update for this add-on will become available. This update will use your interest profile to re-rank the output of a search engine and will allow you to evaluate the technology I produce without getting in your way.<br />          
			</p>
			<br/>
			<h4>How about my privacy?</h4>
			<p style="margin-bottom:0.4em;">
     			I thought really hard about this and I'm convinced that I've come up with a process that completely guarantees your privacy. When you install the add-on, it will generate a unique random id for your browser instance. After that, the add-on will always use this id to communicate with the server. So I have no idea who you are. The add-on also doesn't capture the URL and source HTML of private pages you visit (banking, e-mail, FaceBook, other websites that require log-in, ...). It achieves this by automatically filtering out all URL's starting with HTTPS://. If the URL is a normal HTTP:// one, it will send the source HTML and URL to the server. The server will then do a request to the same URL and will only save the data in the database if the HTML the server gets back is exactly the same as the data it received from the add-on. Hence, the add-on will only capture data from websites that are publicly visible.<br />          
			</p>
			<br/>
			<h4>Why should I install it?</h4>
			<p style="margin-bottom:0.4em;">
     			It'll be incredibly useful for the project. Because there are no publicly available corpora or datasets for this, I need to collect my own data and I need as much as possible. You're also helping out science and the field of Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval. Last but not least, at the end of the project 1 of the participants will be awarded with a price worth Â£50. However, because I want the prize to be one that people really want, I'm hoping that <a href="nm417@cam.ac.uk">you will tell me</a> what you think a good prize wood be. <br />          
			</p>
			<br/>
			<h4>What happens with my data after the project?</h4>
			<p style="margin-bottom:0.4em;">
     			The project is not intending to make all of the collected publicly available after the project; hence your data will be safely deleted. However, if the project produces a tool that makes searching the internet so much more awesome, you'll have contributed to that and you'll be able to benefit from it. <br />

			<h4>What's CSTIT?</h4>
			<p style="margin-bottom:0.8em;">
     			CSTIT is an MPhil in <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/admissions/cstit/structure.html">Computer Speech, Text and Internet Technology</a> at the University of Cambridge. It's a one-year Masters course on the state-of-the-art in Speech and Language Processing and its application to Internet Technology. The main aim of the MPhil course is to teach the fundamental theory of speech and natural language processing and its use in a variety of advanced applications, especially those related to the Internet.<br/>
</p>
<ul style="margin-bottom:1em;"><li>Speech Processing: analysis, speech recognition, speech synthesis</li><li>
Language Processing (computational linguistics): syntax, parsing, semantics, discourse</li><li>
Applications: information retrieval, information extraction, dialogue systems, machine translation, question answering.</li></ul>
			<p style="margin-bottom:0.4em;">
The CSTIT is a one-year postgraduate course, which combines lectures, practicals, seminars and a substantial research project. It starts off with a term of taught material (lectures and structured practicals) covering the foundations of speech and language processing. In the second term, students attend lectures on more advanced topics, participate in a small group seminar in which they study and present material on a research topic, undertake two longer practicals and start on their research project. A dissertation is submitted in the third week in June and students give presentations on their projects in the last week in June. This website and the offered Firefox add-on are a part of my research project in Personalized Search.<br />

			<h4>I would like to thank ...</h4>
			<p style="margin-bottom:0em;">
     			First of all I would like to thank <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/labs/Cambridge/">Microsoft Research</a> and more specifically <b>Dr. Filip Radlinski</b> for having volunteered to supervise my CSTIT research project. I would also like to thank <b>Dr. Stephen Clark</b> (University of Cambridge) for being my internal supervisor and keeping me on track. Special thanks also goes to the <a href="http://www.caret.cam.ac.uk">Center for Applied Research in Education Technologies</a> at the University of Cambridge for providing me with a server for hosting this website and capturing the necessary data.<br />
